# Final Project Proposal

# VR Space Exploration/UAV control

With VR, a simple 360 camera attached to a payload to a High altitutde balloon could provide enough information to create a scene for users to feel as though they are flying through space. In addition, information can be overlayed on the screen with information about pressure, altitude. In addition, head motions can be used to fly a drone or UAV.

# High Intensity Training

VR can be used to train football players like quarter backs to make quick decisions using the peripery of their vision without having to suffer consequenses of grueling tackles.

# RPG games

Using first person point of view, a basic tool for a VR game would be a shooter RPG game. Even a simple version of a first person point of view game such as pacman would be great.
